I'm a graduate of Zetech University, majored in BBIT with a specialization in Information Technology. I've done a lot of full-stack work, though now I'm mostly focused on back-end. I especially enjoy working with LARAVEL.


Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 5 years ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web products for both business and consumer use.

With my strong conceptualization ability, I am able to visualize and create beautiful works. Lastly, you can find me mostly tweaking stylesheets and creating fluid user experiences.

I am adept at handling multiple design projects in a fast paced environment. Excellent at time management, organization, problem solving and meeting deadlines.

I'm passionate about bringing both the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible, human code matters to me.
